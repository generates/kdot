## Plugins

The goal is to make the typical software development process easier end-to-end,
but everyone's process is different so you can install optional "plugins" that
will work with `kdot` to make different parts of the process easier. The
official plugins are listed here:

### kdot-webdriver
> Resource configuration for Selenium Grid, Chrome, and Firefox

### kdot-actions-runner
>

### kdot-auth-proxy
>

### kdot-redis
> Resource configuration for non-production Redis instances

This plugin makes it easy to add a non-production Redis instance to your
cluster. For example, if you need a Redis instance for a personal or CI
namespace, but don't care about availability and persistence, then you can
use this plugin to easily setup a Redis instance without having to configure it
yourself.
